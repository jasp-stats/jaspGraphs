# Plotly Notes

Some ideas for converting jasp plots to plotly automatically.


things that need to be done

- [ ] fixes for all the Geoms in jaspGraphs
    - [x] jaspGeomPoint
    - [x] jaspGeomLine
    - [x] GeomAbline2
    - [x] GeomAlignedText
    - [ ] GeomRangeFrame
    
these last three need js solutions

- [ ] jaspResults to understand what to do for interactivity

- [ ] results.js needs to be able to show a plotly figure.
  - probably the exported html files contain a lot of overlap, this should be stripped.


would be nice to link certain plots, e.g., a plot with histograms on the top and side.
